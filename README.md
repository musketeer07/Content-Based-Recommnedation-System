# Content-Based-Recommnedation-System

A content-based recommendation engine is a type of recommendation system that makes suggestions to users based on their past interactions with items and their content attributes. In this case, we can build a content-based recommendation engine using Netflix and IMDb datasets, where we can recommend movies to users based on the similarity between the content attributes of the movies they have watched and the movies they haven't watched.

The first step in building a content-based recommendation engine is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the datasets to understand the data and extract insights. In this case, we can analyze the Netflix and IMDb datasets to extract the following insights:

1. Netflix Dataset:

- Number of movies and TV shows available.
- Distribution of ratings and reviews.
- Popular genres and categories.
- Duration of movies and TV shows.
- Cast and crew members.

2. IMDb Dataset:

- Movie titles, genres, and release years.
- Ratings and reviews.
- Cast and crew members.
- Plot summaries.
- User reviews.

After performing EDA, we can extract the relevant features and create a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering. We can use the following steps to build a content-based recommendation engine:

1. Select a user and their watched movies.
2. Extract the content features for each watched movie (e.g., director, genre, cast, crew, plot summary).
3. Calculate the similarity between each watched movie and all the other movies in the dataset based on the content features.
4. Recommend the top movies with the highest similarity score.

This process can be repeated for all users in the dataset, and the recommendations can be improved over time as more data is collected and more advanced algorithms are implemented.
